Adorable analogies aside, Dropbox 2.0 for Android offers a host of new features. These include Favorites, which allows you to star and access files offline; Bulk Uploads, for adding multiple files simultaneously; File Renaming, don't make me explain that; and the ability to import and export from local storage. It will also support the new Ice Cream Sandwich OS. And for students, or at least people that have held onto their old college email accounts, Dropbox is offering 500MB of bonus storage for every new member they refer to the service - double the standard referral deal.
